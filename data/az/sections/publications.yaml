      summary:
        "The temperature data of oil wells of BP was analized, visualized and outliers were indicated.
        The data was provided in Excel, and was tranformed and moved to MongoDB by us, to improve query time
        with date ranges. PyQT5 was used to create user-friendly interface to query date range and visu"

    paper:
      summary:
        "The existing Power Supply Unit (PSU) at Axis Communication contains a fully discrete solution that lacks flexibility for future updates. This research aims to address critical challenges by exploring methods to enhance speed, reduce PCB area, and introduce flexibility to the existing hardware solution. The approach involves replacing hardware functionalities within the control unit with software-controlled microcontroller units (MCU), specifically STM32 chips."
