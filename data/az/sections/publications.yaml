      summary:
        "The temperature data of oil wells of BP was analized, visualized and outliers were indicated.
        The data was provided in Excel, and was tranformed and moved to MongoDB by us, to improve query time
        with date ranges. PyQT5 was used to create user-friendly interface to query date range and visu"
